      | We bring you VodQA shots which is a bimonthly event scheduled to be held on last Thursday on alternate months where the QAs in Hyderabad will come together to explore new realms of testing. While VodQA provides a larger platform to engage with QA community in Hyderabad and share our learnings, it is logistically difficult to conduct it multiple times a year as the community had suggested few times. Technology is changing at the blink of an eye and we could not wait for a year to meet the community.
